# Cub3D

#### We had to create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective, using Ray-Casting principles.

## Usage

```bash
$ make bonus
$ ./cub3D_bonus resources/maps/subject.cub 800 600
```

_The first argument is the map, the second the Window Width, and the third the Window Height._
